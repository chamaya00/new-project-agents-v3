Update this repository to a factory release. Nothing here happens on a
schedule and nothing happens to any other repository: this command proposes a
diff in one repository, and a human merges it or does not.

`$1` is the release to move to, for example `v1.2.0`. If it is empty, read the
latest release tag of `chamaya00/agent-factory` and use that.

Everything you copy comes out of the factory repository at that tag, read with
`mcp__github__get_file_contents` against `chamaya00/agent-factory` with `ref`
set to the tag. Do not read it from an installed plugin: a cloud session has
none, and the whole point of naming a tag is that the answer does not depend on
what happens to be on the machine you are running on.

## 1. Work out where this repository is

Read `.claude/agent-factory.json`.

**It is missing.** This repository was provisioned before the roles were
vendored, or was never provisioned at all. Check whether
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls the factory. If it does, this is the older
arrangement: continue, and say in the pull request body that it moves the
repository onto vendored roles for the first time. If it does not, this is not
a factory repository - stop and say so rather than turning it into one, which
is what `/new-project` is for.

**It is there and its version already equals the target.** Say so and stop. Do
not open an empty pull request.

**It is behind.** Continue, and remember both versions for the body.

If the tag does not exist in the factory, say so and stop rather than falling
back to a branch. A release is a commit somebody reviewed; the default branch
is whatever landed last.

## 2. Collect what changes

Read these out of the factory at `$1`:

- `agents/*.md` - every role
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` - every skill
- `commands/retro.md`, `decompose.md`, `update-agents.md` - the commands a
  project gets. Not `new-project.md`, which stays in the factory.

Compare each against the copy in `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, and
`.claude/commands/`. Note which are new, which changed, and which exist here
but no longer exist in the factory. A role that was removed upstream gets
deleted here too, and gets its own line in the body, because a stale role that
nothing maintains is worse than no role.

Then read `.github/workflows/*.yml` and find every line matching
`uses: chamaya00/agent-factory/...@`. Those are the workflow pins. Collect the
ones not already at the target version.

There is no marketplace `ref` to move: this repository loads its commands and
roles from its own `.claude/` directory, so the copies you are writing in this
same commit are the only thing that decides which release it runs. That
includes this command - after this merges, `/update-agents` here is the copy
from `$1`.

## The callers, which are not only their pins

A caller's `on:` block is the factory's. Its `with:` inputs are the project's.
That split is the whole of this section, and getting it wrong either breaks a
project or silently withholds a release from it.

Moving only the pin used to be the whole job, and that was wrong: `v1.14.0`
adds a `pull_request: [closed]` trigger, without which an objective never
learns that a child's work merged and stops mid-chain. A release can change
what a caller has to listen for, and a pin move does not carry that.

So compare each caller against its template in the release at
`plugins/agent-factory/templates/project/.github/workflows/`, and treat the
two halves differently:

- **The `on:` block and the `uses:` line are the factory's.** Bring them to the
  template's shape, substituting `$1` for `__FACTORY_VERSION__`. A trigger the
  template has and the caller does not is a trigger the release needs.
- **Everything else in the caller is the project's.** `with:` inputs, job
  names, and the comments a project wrote about its own gate stay exactly as
  they are. `ci.yml` in particular carries the project's `check-name` and its
  `commands`, which the template cannot know and must never overwrite.

Never rewrite a caller wholesale from the template. It reads as tidying and it
deletes the one thing in that file nobody else can reconstruct.

If a caller has diverged in a way you cannot reconcile - a trigger it
deliberately removed, a job the template no longer has - do not guess. Leave
that file alone, and say plainly in the body which file it was and what you did
not do to it, so the reader knows the release is only partly applied.

If nothing at all differs, say so and stop.

## 3. Propose it

One branch, one commit, one pull request:

- `mcp__github__create_branch` from the default branch
- `mcp__github__push_files` with every changed file in a single commit
- `mcp__github__create_pull_request`

What goes in the commit:

- The changed role, skill, and command files, verbatim from the factory. Do not
  edit them on the way through. A local edit makes this repository quietly
  disagree with every other one, and the next run of this command overwrites it
  anyway.
- All four workflow callers moved to the target version together. The roles,
  the workflows around them, and the commands that maintain them are one
  release; taking half of it is how they drift apart.
- `.claude/agent-factory.json` with the new version, and the role, skill, and
  command lists refreshed to what was actually written.

Leave alone, always:

- Everything under `.claude/memory/`. Those are this repository's lessons, and
  they are the reason the roles are copied in rather than shared live. Nothing
  in an update reads them, writes them, or carries them anywhere.
- `.claude/settings.json`, apart from the one `SessionStart` entry named in
  step 3c. Permissions, env, and the project's own hooks are the project's.
- The part of `CLAUDE.md` outside the managed block. That half describes this
  product - its stack, its commands, what it is - and belongs to the repository.
  The block is a different matter; see below.

## 3b. Replace the managed block in `CLAUDE.md`

`CLAUDE.md` was skipped entirely for a long time, on the stated grounds that it
describes the product rather than the process. That was true of about half of
it. The other half - how work moves, what drives an objective, the standing
rules, the labels - describes the shared system, and skipping it meant every
release quietly desynchronised every project's own description of itself. The
drift was invisible until somebody read a sentence that contradicted the roles
they were watching run.

So the file carries a boundary now:

```
<!-- agent-factory:begin -->
...shared process prose, owned here...
<!-- agent-factory:end -->
```

**If both markers are present:** replace everything between them with the block
from this release's `templates/project/CLAUDE.md`, and change nothing outside
them. That is the whole operation - no merging, no reconciling, no cleverness.

**If the markers are absent**, the repository predates them, and inserting them
is the one genuinely dangerous step in this command. Sections that the factory
now owns may have been edited in place over months, and wrapping them means the
next update overwrites whatever is there. So do not wrap silently:

1. Find the sections the block covers by heading. They are stable names and they
   sit together at the end of the file.
2. Diff what is there against this release's block, and **put the differences in
   the pull request body, quoted**, under a heading that says these lines will be
   replaced. Prose a person wrote about their own repository is the thing being
   destroyed, and they get to see it before it goes.
3. Anything that is plainly specific to this repository - a note about a step
   only this project needs, a caveat about its own setup - is moved *outside*
   the block rather than dropped. Say in the body where it went.
4. Only then insert the markers.

**If a marker is present but malformed** - one without the other, or `end`
before `begin` - stop and say so. Do not guess where the block was meant to
start; a wrong guess deletes the repository's own prose and looks like a
successful update.

**When the block cannot be replaced for any reason**, report rather than skip
silently: list, in the body, the statements in `CLAUDE.md` that this release has
made false. A drift a person can see is a chore; a drift nobody can see is what
this step exists to end.

## 3c. The session-start hook, and the one key it is wired by

Two files, and they do not travel the same way, for the same reason `CLAUDE.md`
needed a block: one is wholly ours and one is not.

**`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` is wholly the factory's.** Copy it wholesale,
exactly like a skill, and make sure it stays executable - a hook without the
execute bit is wired, silent, and looks like it ran.

**`.claude/settings.json` belongs to the project.** It is where permissions, env,
and the project's own hooks live, and overwriting it destroys configuration
nobody asked you to touch. So make a **bounded edit**:

- Add or update **only** the `SessionStart` entry that points at
  `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`. Leave every other key
  exactly as it is, including other hooks on the same event.
- If the file does not exist, create it carrying that one key and nothing else.
- Never add a `permissions` key, and never widen one that is there. The factory
  does not get to decide what a project's automation may do, and
  `project-guard` now fails a diff that tries - which is a backstop, not
  permission to lean on it.

**Say it in the body, under a `Privilege change:` line.** A repository that
merges this starts executing a script on every session start that it was not
executing before. That is true even though the script is ours and does nothing
but report, and it is exactly the kind of change this system refuses to let
through quietly. The guard will stop the pull request without that line, and it
is right to.

What the hook buys is worth stating for the person reading: `CLAUDE.md` is
static and can only say a session is the driver; the hook runs, so it can say
what is actually waiting. If a project would rather not run it, deleting the
`SessionStart` entry costs them the briefing and nothing else - the driver role
comes from `CLAUDE.md` and survives.

## 4. Say what it does in the body

The point of the pull request is that somebody reads it before it runs, so
write the body for that reader:

- The two versions, from and to.
- Which roles, skills, and commands changed, one line each, saying what
  actually changed in behaviour rather than that the file changed.
- Which pins moved.
- Anything removed upstream, called out separately.

This pull request moves `uses:` lines, which is a privilege change - it changes
which code runs against this repository's token. The project guard fails it
unless the body carries a line starting `Privilege change:` saying what moved
and why. Write that line: naming the pins and the two versions is enough. Do
not treat it as a formality to satisfy, and do not let a red check here become
routine - a check people expect to be red is one they stop reading.

Say which pin the checks ran at rather than assuming, because both are
possible and the difference matters. For a pull request from a branch in this
same repository, Actions takes each workflow file from the head of the branch,
so the callers in this diff are the ones that run and the release is being
exercised here. From a fork, or where a caller is not part of this diff, the
old pin runs and a green pull request proves only that the diff is well-formed.
Look at which it was - the guard job's log names the version it ran - and say
so. Where the old pin ran, the first real run at the new one is the next pull
request after this merges, and it is worth watching.

If the person who has to merge this is also the person who owns the factory,
say plainly which changes came from a factory release they cut and which are
local drift being reverted. Those are different things and they read the same
in a diff.
