# Tells a session, on its first turn, what the objectives in this repository are

# having to ask.
#
# This is the one thing CLAUDE.md structurally cannot do. CLAUDE.md is always
# loaded and says a session is the driver; it cannot say what is currently
# waiting, because it is a static file. This runs, so it can.
#
# Deliberately not `set -e`, and it always exits 0: this reports, it never
# gates. A session that cannot start because a briefing failed is worse than
# the briefing being missing, and the briefing is a convenience - the driver
# role itself comes from CLAUDE.md and survives this script doing nothing.
#
# Silence is a valid outcome and the common one. Nothing open, no credentials,
# no network, a repository not using objectives at all: print nothing and get
# out of the way.
